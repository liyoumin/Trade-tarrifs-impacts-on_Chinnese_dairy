Data and Period Definitions

Using the provided dataset of U.S. dairy exports to China (monthly data), we segmented the timeline into four key policy phases and computed monthly price and quantity outcomes for each:
  Control (Baseline): June 2018 – This single month represents the immediate pre-trade-war baseline (just before retaliatory tariffs fully took hold).
  Trade War: July 2018 – June 2019, covering roughly the first year of the U.S.–China trade war when retaliatory tariffs on U.S. dairy were in effect.
  COVID: June 2020 – June 2021, capturing the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. Notably, this period followed the Phase One trade deal (signed Jan 2020) when China began tariff exclusions for U.S. dairy products,    significantly lowering effective tariffs by March 2020 apps.fas.usda.gov.
  Adjustment: June 2022 – June 2023, representing the post-COVID “new normal,” where trade continued under adjusted policies (tariffs largely eased) and global market shifts.
Note: We omitted mid-2019 to mid-2020 from distinct categorization because that interim saw gradual policy changes (Phase One negotiations) and isn’t a primary phase of interest. Each defined period is about one year long (except the one-month baseline) to allow comparison of average monthly outcomes under different conditions.

Methodology – Comparing Period Averages and Treatment Effects
We treat the trade war and COVID-related policy changes as “interventions” affecting trade, and we analyze their impact on export price and quantity using before-and-after comparisons. In an ideal scenario, a difference-in-differences (DiD) approach could be applied by comparing the change in U.S. exports to China (the treated group) with a control group not subject to these shocks (for example, U.S. dairy exports to another market or China’s imports from non-US suppliers). Lacking a direct control series in our dataset, we approximate the treatment effect by examining the change in average outcomes from the baseline to each subsequent period. This is analogous to an Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT) where each policy phase is a “treatment” applied to the trade flow:
  The Trade War effect can be inferred by the drop in exports after June 2018 when tariffs were imposed, compared to the baseline.
  The COVID phase effect is evaluated relative to the prior trade war period, noting the rebound coinciding with tariff reductions and pandemic disruptions.
  The Adjustment phase effect is assessed relative to the COVID phase, to see if trends persisted or changed once the initial shocks subsided.
We calculated the mean and median monthly price and quantity in each period, and also examined the distribution of monthly values to capture volatility or outliers. A boxplot was used to visualize the distribution of monthly outcomes for each period (with the single-month baseline shown as a point). This helps illustrate not just the mean shift but also variability and any extreme values in each phase. All prices are expressed in USD per kg (unit export value), and quantities in metric tons. We ensured consistent time alignment (each period covers the same months year-over-year where applicable) and included all available monthly data in each range. There were no missing months in the series for the period analyzed; any months with zero exports (if they had occurred) would have been included as 0, but in this case U.S. dairy exports to China never dropped completely to zero, even at the trough of the trade war. Outliers were retained as they reflect real trade fluctuations (e.g. an unusually high unit price or low volume month); the boxplot uses standard IQR rules to display them.

1. Input cost pass-through equation (feed price dynamics)

Dependent variable:
The monthly change in log domestic feed cost in China (

Explanatory variables:​
:changes in Chinese tariff rate on alfalfa imports, current and lags.
: changes in the world price of alfalfa (import parity), current and lags.​
: other controls (e.g. exchange rates, input subsidies, shipping costs).
: month and year fixed effects to absorb seasonality and long-run trends.

Interpretation of coefficients:
: how a tariff change on alfalfa passes through to domestic feed prices after 
: how global alfalfa price shocks pass into domestic feed costs.
This equation captures the supply-side channel: tariffs on imported feed inputs → Chinese feed prices.

2. Farm-gate milk price equation (milk price dynamics)
Dependent variable:
Monthly change in log Chinese farm-gate milk price.

Explanatory variables:​
: changes in domestic feed cost (from eqn 1), lagged.
: changes in Chinese tariffs on imported dairy (the output side).
: other demand/supply controls (e.g. consumer demand shocks, policy interventions).
: month & year fixed effects.

Interpretation of coefficients:
: cost pass-through — how changes in feed costs transmit to farm-gate milk prices after 
: competition effect — how dairy tariffs directly affect domestic farm-gate milk prices (by changing competition from imports).

This captures both:
Cost channel: feed cost shocks → higher milk production costs → higher farm prices.
Competition channel: dairy tariffs make imports more expensive, reducing foreign competition, potentially pushing up local prices.
Results – Price and Quantity Distributions Across Periods 
Monthly Price (USD/kg) and Quantity (tons) of U.S. dairy exports to China across the four periods (baseline, trade war, COVID, adjustment). Each box shows the interquartile range (IQR) and median (line) of monthly values in that period; “Control” has a single data-point (June 2018).

From the plotted distributions, it is evident that each policy phase corresponds with distinct shifts in export quantity and price:
Baseline (June 2018): Just before the full trade war impact, U.S. dairy export volume to China was relatively high (about 34,500 tons in that month) at a moderate unit price (~$1.34/kg). This reflects normal trade conditions with China’s import tariff at or near its pre-war level (the retaliatory tariff had only partially begun). We take this as the reference point.
Trade War (Jul 2018–Jun 2019): Once China imposed steep retaliatory tariffs (effective July 2018), U.S. dairy exports to China plummeted. The boxplot shows the median monthly quantity during this year fell to around 18–19 thousand tons, roughly 45% lower than the June 2018 baseline (34.5k) usdec.org. In fact, U.S. dairy volume to China dropped by about -43% in the first several months after the tariffs, compared to a year earlier usdec.org. (Notably, China’s overall dairy imports were growing in that time, +13% in early 2019, but U.S. exporters “watched from the sidelines” as tariffs eroded their competitiveness usdec.org – effectively a real-world difference-in-differences scenario where U.S. lost market share while other countries gained). The tariff rates on U.S. dairy peaked at 40–45% during 2018 usdec.org – at least +25 percentage points above the tariffs faced by competitors like the EU or New Zealand, tilting the playing field usdec.org. This “treatment” – a hefty price wedge – made U.S. products expensive in China, causing Chinese buyers to scale down purchases dramatically. The data shows one of the lowest months was May 2019 (~13.3k tons, the whisker low end), indicating sustained suppression.

Despite the volume collapse, the price per unit of the exports that did occur increased during the trade war year. The median export price in this period was around $1.58–1.60/kg, higher than the $1.34 baseline. Some months saw even higher unit values, up to ~$2.3/kg (visible as an outlier). This could imply a composition shift: with tariffs in place, perhaps only higher-value dairy products (e.g. specialized ingredients or infant formula) could viably ship (or U.S. exporters had to move less product but of higher value). In essence, the trade war’s immediate treatment effect was negative on quantity (a steep decline) while possibly raising the average price of what little volume remained (since low-value bulk commodities like skim milk powder may have lost share). It’s also possible U.S. exporters had to absorb some tariff cost by lowering prices, but the data’s rising unit values suggest limited price discounting overall – instead it was mostly lost sales. This aligns with economic expectations: a tariff acts like a tax that reduces quantity; any effect on price received by the exporter can vary, but here U.S. dairy couldn’t fully drop prices enough to maintain volume, given a 25%+ price disadvantage usdec.org. The result was a major hit to export volumes, confirming a significant treatment effect of the trade war policy on trade flows.

COVID (Jun 2020–Jun 2021): By mid-2020, two things changed: (1) China implemented the Phase One tariff exclusion process, lowering effective tariffs on many U.S. ag products including dairy (down to roughly the pre-war or first-round levels, e.g. dairy tariff ~15% vs 45% earlier). (2) The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted supply chains and consumption patterns worldwide. During this period, our data shows a dramatic rebound in export quantity. Monthly volumes recovered to a median around 35–38 thousand tons, comparable to or even slightly above the 2018 pre-tariff level. The average monthly quantity in the COVID phase was ~36,000 tons, nearly +82% higher than the depressed trade-war average – essentially regaining what was lost. This rebound suggests that removing the tariff barrier acted like a positive treatment: once Chinese importers could get tariff exemptions, U.S. dairy became price-competitive again and demand surged. Indeed, U.S. dairy shipments to China picked up in 2020; for example, U.S. cheese exports rose once China began approving tariff waivers in March 2020 apps.fas.usda.gov. By 2021, Chinese import demand was robust (China’s milk powder imports were forecast up ~13% in 2021 following the 2020 dip apps.fas.usda.gov). The pandemic initially caused logistical hiccups, but China’s strong food imports (partly government-driven under the Phase One deal) helped U.S. dairy exports “rebound in 2020” californiadairymagazine.com.

In terms of price, the COVID-period unit values moderated slightly from the trade-war highs – the median price was around $1.50/kg. With tariffs mostly out of the way, the U.S. was exporting a broader mix of dairy products again (including possibly more milk powder or whey at lower unit values alongside high-value products), bringing the average price closer to normal. Global dairy market conditions also played a role: international prices were recovering after a lull – the FAO Dairy Price Index in the first half of 2021 was ~20% higher than a year prior ifcndairy.org, reflecting strong import demand. Our data’s price trend aligns: still higher than 2018 baseline, but not as extreme as the trade war spike. Overall, the COVID phase shows a partial reversal of the trade war’s effect: once the “treatment” of tariffs was lifted (the policy environment improved), quantities bounced back significantly (a large positive change, effectively an ATE of the tariff removal), while prices normalized to an intermediate level. The ability of exports to not only recover but slightly exceed pre-war levels (despite pandemic disruptions) highlights how critical the policy relief was – it unlocked pent-up demand.

Adjustment (Jun 2022–Jun 2023): In this phase, trade continued under the adjusted policy regime (tariffs remained low due to ongoing exclusions/Phase One, although the formal agreement ended, China still often kept tariffs manageable via waivers). This period was also marked by global market volatility: world dairy prices hit record highs in early-to-mid 2022
oecd.org. The data reflects these conditions. U.S. export quantities to China remained very strong – median monthly volume was around 38–40k tons, the highest of all periods. Several months in late 2022 and early 2023 saw record shipment volumes (the max in the boxplot reaches ~50k tons). This indicates that U.S. dairy exports not only recovered but surpassed pre-trade-war levels during the adjustment phase. One driving factor was China’s continued import needs: despite a brief import slowdown in 2022 (especially for some products like whole milk powder)
oecd.org, by 2023 China was reopening from zero-COVID and demand for imported dairy picked up again. U.S. exporters, having weathered the trade war, were now well-positioned to supply this demand.

Meanwhile, prices were elevated. The average unit price in 2022–23 was about $1.62/kg, and many months were in the $1.6–1.8 range. This mirrors global trends: the FAO Dairy Price Index in 2022 jumped ~20% to an all-time highoecd.org, with prices peaking around mid-2022 before easing late in the year. High feed and energy costs worldwide contributed to pricier dairy products
oecd.org, and those costs were passed along to importers. So, the adjustment period shows high price-high volume conditions – a stark contrast to the low volume of the trade war. It suggests that by this stage, the punitive tariffs’ effect had largely been neutralized (U.S. products were effectively on par with foreign competitors’ tariffs) and Chinese buyers, facing expensive dairy globally, were still importing large quantities from the U.S. The “treatment effect” of the earlier trade war was essentially absent here – volumes returned to their trajectory as if the treatment was removed. If anything, one could argue a positive treatment in this phase from policy normalization: exports flourished, implying a sizable favorable impact relative to the counterfactual of continued high tariffs. The price surge, however, was externally driven by global inflationary pressures rather than Chinese policy; it affected all exporters similarly
oecd.org. We handled potential outliers by noting that price variation was high but not aberrant – the whole distribution shifted up due to market forces.

Interpretation and Policy Impact Summary

Each phase’s pattern underscores how policy shocks translated into real trade outcomes for U.S. dairy exports to China:
Trade War Tariffs (Negative Shock): The retaliatory tariffs imposed in mid-2018 had an immediate and significant negative impact on export quantities. The analysis shows roughly a 40–50% decline in average monthly volume during the first year of tariffs relative to the pre-tariff baseline, a drop also documented by industry sources usdec.org. This is a clear indication of high price elasticity – Chinese importers sharply cut purchases of U.S. dairy when faced with 25%+ higher prices due to tariffs. A quasi-difference-in-differences view (comparing to other countries) confirms it was the tariff that caused the decline: notably, China’s overall imports rose in that period, while U.S. share collapsed usdec.org. Prices received by U.S. exporters for the reduced volume did not fall – in fact, average unit value rose, suggesting that U.S. exporters weren’t able to simply drop prices to counteract the tariff fully (likely because a 25% price cut was not feasible). Instead, the product mix shifted or only the most valued products could bear the tariff. The treatment effect implication: the trade war acted like a tax that not only reduced trade volumes (the intended pressure on U.S. exporters) but also potentially altered the composition of trade. In absence of a formal control group in our analysis, the large before-after swing itself is compelling evidence of the tariff’s effect. If we were to estimate an Average Treatment Effect, we’d say the tariff policy led to roughly a -15,000 ton/month reduction in exports on average (versus baseline) and had a mild +$0.3/kg effect on unit values (though the latter might not directly be “caused” by tariff but rather by selection of what still sold).

Phase One & COVID (Positive Shock amidst disruption): The Phase One agreement in early 2020, effectively removing much of the tariff burden, served as a positive policy shock (removal of a negative treatment). Our results show that once this occurred, U.S. dairy export quantities rebounded to pre-war levels despite the coincident challenges of COVID-19. This implies the policy relief had a strong positive treatment effect, roughly on the order of a +15k to +18k ton/month boost relative to the tariff period (essentially undoing the drop). It’s a real-world validation of how sensitive trade was to the tariff barrier: as soon as the barrier lowered, buyers returned. During the COVID year, the market volatility was high, but China actually increased imports of certain dairy products. For example, by 2021 China’s imports of milk powders were rising again apps.fas.usda.gov, and industry analysis noted China’s demand was resilient even during the pandemic dairyfoods.com. The boxplot’s spread for COVID period is somewhat wide, indicating some month-to-month fluctuation (likely due to pandemic logistics), but generally high volumes. Prices in this period were influenced by global supply-demand swings rather than trade policy: early 2020 saw a dip in dairy prices, then a surge in 2021 as global demand outpaced supply ifcndairy.org. Our observed slight decline in average unit price from the tariff period is consistent with a normalization of trade (more lower-value bulk dairy in the mix again). The key takeaway is that the removal of the tariff “treatment” allowed the quantity trajectory to recover. In a diff-in-diff sense, if one compared U.S. vs. other exporters from 2019 to 2020, the U.S. likely gained back ground (indeed, U.S. cheese exports +6% in 2020apps.fas.usda.gov, etc.). Thus, the Phase One period mitigated the trade war damage, demonstrating a significant treatment effect in the opposite direction (policy easing leads to export surge).

Adjustment Period (Post-shock normalization): By 2022–2023, the trade relationship had mostly stabilized with de facto low tariffs continuing. The high export volumes in our data indicate that U.S. dairy’s market trajectory resumed and even exceeded the old normal. This suggests that the lasting impact of the trade war was minimal once policies adjusted – there was no permanent loss in capacity or relationships that couldn’t be restored. However, it’s worth noting that external factors (like China’s domestic production, demand cycles, and global prices) also shape the trajectory. For instance, the record global dairy prices in 2022
oecd.org contributed to higher unit values; Chinese import demand in 2022 was actually soft for some dairy commoditiesoecd.org, but picked up in 2023 after China’s economic reopening. Our period averaging (mid-2022 to mid-2023) smoothed out some of these within-phase changes, but overall shows strong trade. The quantity boxplot for adjustment has the highest median and a relatively large IQR, reflecting some volatility (possibly due to sporadic buying spurts or inventory adjustments by China). From a policy perspective, this phase illustrates adaptation: both countries adjusted to the new environment (tariffs were no longer a hindrance, and the focus shifted to navigating global market conditions). If considering a treatment effect, one might say the net effect of the entire cycle (tariff imposition then removal) by this stage was zero or even positive on trade volumes – i.e., trade volumes eventually caught up to where they would have been, as if the shock was temporary. In fact, U.S. agricultural exports in many sectors saw compensatory growth after the trade war trough once market access was restored. For dairy specifically, U.S. exporters had to diversify during the trade war, but once China reopened, they were able to ramp up exports fast, indicating a resilient supply response.

In summary, each policy phase had a distinct impact on the price and quantity trajectory of U.S. dairy exports to China:
The Trade War phase severely curtailed quantities (a large negative shock), underscoring how retaliatory tariffs act as a strong deterrent to trade usdec.org.The COVID/Phase One phase saw a rebound in quantity once tariffs were lifted, even amidst a global crisis – demonstrating the removal of trade barriers can quickly restore trade flows. Prices in this phase were moderate, shaped by global trends.
The Adjustment phase featured high trade volumes and high prices, indicating that with policy normalized, underlying supply and demand factors took over. Global price spikes drove up unit valuesoecd.org, but U.S. export volumes remained robust, hitting new highs as the market fully adjusted to post-war, post-pandemic conditions.
From a treatment effect standpoint, one could infer that the average treatment effect of the trade war tariffs was roughly a 40-50% reduction in export volume (with recovery after treatment removal) and a slight increase in unit price for the remaining trade. Had a formal difference-in-differences analysis been conducted with a proper control (for example, comparing U.S. exports to China vs. U.S. exports to other destinations or vs. a similar product not tariffed), it would likely quantify a significant negative impact attributable to the tariffs (this is corroborated by external estimates of a 76% value reduction in U.S. ag exports to China due to retaliationers.usda.gov). Conversely, the Phase One policy easing can be viewed as a treatment that had a positive effect of comparable magnitude in the opposite direction – effectively restoring trade volumes. The final adjustment period suggests that any long-run effects of these shocks were limited; policy interventions changed the short-to-medium term trajectory, but ultimately the trade found a new equilibrium, with policy support (or at least the cessation of adverse policy) being crucial to that recovery.

Conclusion:
Analyzing the four periods with a combination of descriptive statistics and quasi-treatment effect reasoning reveals how U.S.–China trade policy and global events drove the fortunes of U.S. dairy exports. The retaliatory trade war tariffs sharply depressed export quantities and can be seen as a “treatment” that caused a clear structural break in the trade data
usdec.org. When that treatment was rolled back during COVID/Phase One, exports surged back, highlighting the efficacy of policy removal and the resilience of demand. By the Adjustment phase, with stable policy, the trade was primarily influenced by market forces, reaching new highs in volume albeit at higher prices
oecd.org. For stakeholders, these findings underscore the importance of trade policy consistency: punitive tariffs had immediate harmful effects, while negotiated agreements quickly reversed those losses. In practice, employing a more formal econometric approach (e.g., a difference-in-differences with a control market or an interrupted time series model) would further validate these effects, but the stark contrasts in the boxplot speak for themselves. Each policy phase left a distinct imprint on the price and quantity trajectory – from collapse to recovery to growth – illustrating the powerful linkage between policy and trade outcomes in the dairy sector.
